This benchmark: https://github.com/rigtorp/ipc-bench provides latency and throughput tests for TCP sockets, Unix Domain Sockets (UDS), and PIPEs.

Here you have the results on a single CPU 3.3GHz Linux machine :

TCP average latency: 6 us

UDS average latency: 2 us

PIPE average latency: 2 us

TCP average throughput: 253702 msg/s

UDS average throughput: 1733874 msg/s

PIPE average throughput: 1682796 msg/s

66% latency reduction and almost 7X more throughput explain why most performance-critical software has their own IPC custom protocol.
